# Entry
> *Ghouls are said to have been humans who were once forced into cannibalism and,
> after many years spent in dark crypts, underwent a horrifying transformation.
> Only human flesh can satisfy their eternal evil hunger, so they kill people and
> store the remains in the recesses of their lairs.*
