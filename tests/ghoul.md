# Journal entry
> *Ghouls are said to have been humans who were once forced into cannibalism and,
> after many years spent in dark crypts, underwent a horrifying transformation.
> Only human flesh can satisfy their eternal evil hunger, so they kill people and
> store the remains in the recesses of their lairs.*

# Bestiary entry
> *Ghouls and graveirs are hard to describe. In part, they resemble humans - yet
> on the whole, they are the utter negation of all that is human. Though they
> have arms and legs like men, they walk on all fours like dogs or badgers.
> Though they have eerily familiar faces, one searches them in vain for any sign
> of sentiment, reason or even a spark of consciousness. They are driven by one
> thing and one thing only: an insatiable craving for human flesh.*
> 
> *Ghouls and their more dangerous cousins, graveirs, usually feed in small
> groups, at times led by an alghoul. Since they delight most in the taste of
> fresh carcasses, they appear wherever newly-dug graves are to be found:
> cemeteries, crypts, catacombs and battlefields. Whenever the opportunity arises
> they hunt the living as well, especially when they have strength in numbers.*
> 
> *In a one-on-one fight with a trained witcher, a ghoul poses little threat, but
> one must remember that wounded individuals can erupt in a mad frenzy. At such
> times they attack fiercely, paying no heed to their own safety and brushing off
> all wounds. One must likewise bear in mind that ghouls and graveirs are
> particular dangerous around dusk and at night.*
