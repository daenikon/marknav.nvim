# Entry
> *A hunter who knows his prey's habits and behavior will rarely return from his
> hunt empty-handed. To know what forest paths deer are like to trod, to know in
> what muck boars will wallow, to guess when a hare will emerge from its burrow -
> that is half the battle.*
> 
> *What most men do not know is that some monsters also possess such knowledge.
> For example, a royal wyvern from Velen had learned the danger of exposing
> itself to human eyes and arrows by flying high to pick out its prey from afar.
> Instead, it would lurk by the roadside and wait for military transports. In
> this way it grew fat on salted pork and beer, expanding until it resembled a
> dragon more than other, lesser members of its own kind.
> 
> *The witcher thus knew this beast would be much stronger and more resilient than
> a normal wyvern. Even one blow from it could kill - which is why he would need
> to avoid its charge at all costs. He would also be wise to force it to the
> ground with his crossbow or a bomb whenever it tried to fly into the air and
> hurtle down in a deadly dive.*
> 
> *In the end the witcher slew the hideous creature, though not without some
> difficulty. Thanks to this feat, the soldiers could once again send shipments
> of food and equipment needed to conduct the war. Whether that was a good or a
> bad thing - that is an entirely different matter.*
