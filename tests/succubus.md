# Bestiary entry
> *Unlike other monsters, succubi and menads feel no desire to kill, do not crave
> human blood and usually do not, in fact, mean any harm at all. They are
> motivated by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable lust. They try in vain
> to slake this by engaging in sexual acts with any other humanoid species they
> encounter. While it must be admitted that their "victims" rarely put up much
> resistance, this does not mean succubi and menads do not present any danger:
> their never-ending advances, though pleasurable at first, have pushed more than
> one man to madness or even death.*
> 
> *Succubi and menads usually can be found near human settlement, including small
> villages and populous cities. They prowl at night, though when stricken by
> serious need they will leave their lairs during the day as well. They shower
> their affections on men as well as women, the young as well as the old, the
> ugly as well as the beautiful. Some of them are particularly fond of pastors
> and other holy men, whose seduction they treat as a sort of game.*
> 
> *Though succubi are peaceful by nature, when forced to fight they will defend
> themselves fiercely. One should thus not be fooled by their fair appearance â€“
> under the velvety skin of their arms lie muscles of iron, and a blow delivered
> with their rear, goat-like legs or the thick horns on their head can easily
> crush bone.*
