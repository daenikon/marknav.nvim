# Entry
> *No other monster inspires so many myths and fallacies as the alp. People
> believe that this vampire is able to turn into a black dog or a venomous toad.
> They mistake alps for succubi, believing them to be lecherous and inclined to
> seduce handsome young men. Folk tales describe their charm and their beautiful,
> seductive voices, as well as their loathing of virgins. What is true beyond any
> doubt is that they move noiselessly and attack by surprise, rarely giving their
> victims as much as a chance to scream in terror.*
