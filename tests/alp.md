# Journal entry
> *No other monster inspires so many myths and fallacies as the alp. People
> believe that this vampire is able to turn into a black dog or a venomous toad.
> They mistake alps for succubi, believing them to be lecherous and inclined to
> seduce handsome young men. Folk tales describe their charm and their beautiful,
> seductive voices, as well as their loathing of virgins. What is true beyond any
> doubt is that they move noiselessly and attack by surprise, rarely giving their
> victims as much as a chance to scream in terror.*


# Bestiary entry
> *Alps are vampires that resemble bruxae in appearance. They are called phantoms
> by some, a name which fits well enough, for like phantoms they haunt and
> torment men. They usually take on the form of a woman, though they can also
> appear as animals. They are most often found prowling near villages. They
> attack at night and are most active when the moon is full. Alp saliva can make
> one fall asleep, and when applied to a sleeping man, can invoke horrible
> nightmares. Some suggest they are the cause of legends about men who go to
> sleep healthy and are found in the morning white as snow, not a drop of blood
> in their veins.*
> 
> *In combat alps display supernatural speed and incredible (even by vampire
> standards) stamina. One must aim one's sword with great precision, for alps are
> unequaled in the art of evading blows. The Yrden Sign is recommended, for it
> weakens an alp's defenses. Another strategy is to drink the Black Blood potion,
> for alps suck the blood of their victims to deprive them of strength and
> regenerate their own powers.*
> 
> *Unlike bruxae, alps cannot turn invisible, yet like bruxae, they emit a
> shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate. Their greatest asset is
> their agility and they can leap with uncanny lightness that appears to border
> on the power of flight. When in human form, they easily blend in with the
> surrounding community, which makes them very dangerous indeed.*
