> In times long gone, when youth was more
> polite, everything was cheaper, and girls
> were more eager, sorcerers could breathe life
> into inanimate matter and create stone
> servants this way. **Gargoyles** - for I have
> them in mind - can be found in ancient cities
> to this day, but their magic has vanished and
> now they are nothing more than cornice
> decorations. There are, however, exceptions
> such as the Loc Muinne **gargoyles** - still
> enchanted and still dangerous.
> 
> Theoreticians of magic still argue about
> classifying **gargoyles**. I favor the school
> claiming they are a type of golem. For
> **gargoyles** are nothing more than fancy
> sculptures animated with magic and programmed
> to do simple tasks. They can complete only
> the most rudimentary works, so they are most
> often guarding a territory, even if their
> creator turned to dust long ago.
> 
> The **gargoyle** is a magical creature and
> often has surprising tricks at it's sleeve.
> Teleportation for example: an opponent makes
> a blow, and the **gargoyle** disappears only
> to emerge elsewhere at the same moment. Like
> behind it's enemy. It's even worse when the
> **gargoyle** appears over his opponent - then
> it just falls down and crushes it's victim
> beneath the weight of it's stone body. Thanks
> to their medallions, witchers can perceive
> disturbances in magical aura, so they see the
> point where the **gargoyle** will appear
> moments before it materializes, so they have
> time to react. However ordinary people tend
> to die crushed.
> 
> Fighting the **gargoyle** means fighting
> solid rock, so it should not be surprising
> that poisons are useless, as are fire and
> oils causing bleeding. Because of its great
> mass, the **gargoyle's** stone body cannot be
> unbalanced, let alone knocked down.
> Immobilizing one with a trap will fail, as
> **gargoyles** can teleport and will flee
> snares using this ability. They have no
> weaknesses at all.
