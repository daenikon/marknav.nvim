# Entry
> *Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside them. When in beastly
> form, they take the worst traits of each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger
> for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's
> condition comes about through a curse, and the transformations happen outside
> his conscious control. When he reverts to human form, he has no memory of his
> deeds – otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life.*
>
> *Werewolves are active at night, particularly when the moon is full. Though they
> hunt alone, when threatened they will summon wolves to aid them. Werewolves
> rarely feel the need to flee, for few adversaries put up much of a fight
> against them. They strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors
> and regenerate any damage received in mere moments. When fighting werewolves a
> witcher should wield a blade covered in oil harmful to the cursed and have a
> large supply of Devil's Puffballs handy.*
> 
> *A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire
> method for doing this. A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must there
> equip himself with a great deal of patience – and sturdy armor.*
